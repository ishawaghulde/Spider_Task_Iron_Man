        <p id ="start">Genius. Billionaire. Inventor. Playboy. Philanthropist. </p>
        <h1 id ="name">Tony Stark. </h1>
      </div>
      <div><p> I've wanted to use that for so long!</p>
           <p> Anyway, now that I've had my moment let's do something fun.Here are some interesting facts about me</p>
      <div> <p class = "head">My character is based on Howard Hughes</p>
      	    <p>All of the superhero world’s heroes have different origin stories, and it can be baffling to imagine how on earth the creators were able to dream up such fascinating characters. That holds particularly true for Tony Stark, who is an interesting sort of hero– a human, but with no giant origin story for his powers like many of the other humans-turned-heroes. I quite literally created my own powers. Sure, I was smart, but there was no radioactive accident going on. Well, it turns out, my character is based on the legendary American entrepreneur, Howard Hughes. Stan Lee described Hughes as “an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies’ man and finally a nutcase.” While the nutcase part may not apply to me the rest is pretty spot on.</p>

      </div>
      <div><p class = "head"> big female following</p>
      	   <p>Okay, this fact is a little bit hilarious considering my reputation as a ladies’ man. Now, while female fans are becoming a larger population of comic book fans lately, due to all the films coming out that encourage them to check out the original comics, there’s no secret that it was once a fairly male dominated world. And it’s no surprise. While there were some female heroes and villains, a large majority of the really popular characters in the comic book universe were male. And though I might seem like the hero men would be drawn to the most, given that I'm basically an alpha male with brains and plenty of beauties surrounding me, the secret is that my biggest fans in real life are female.</p>
      </div>
      <div><p class="head">I took fashion advice (kind of) from an ex-girlfriend</p>
      	   <p>NOW, now. This is one of those secrets you actually <i>keep</i>. And i said just kind of.I am a fiercely independent guy, and while I might ask my trusty pal J.A.R.V.I.S. for sartorial advice, it’s not something I'd ask a woman, right? Well, not exactly. It turns out, when I first began designing the Iron Man armor, I opted for a metallic grey colour– classic for a robot suit, right? Well, one of my ex-girlfriends shared her advice that the colour was just too frightening and suited for a villain, perhaps, but not for someone who wanted to help people. She suggested I switch it to gold, a friendlier colour. Later, the suit became red and gold and the red and gold shade has become super well known, and a plain grey suit would just be boring in comparison– that ex was a smart lady! Okay, I didn't say that!</p>

      <div><p class="head">I made it to the Forbes wealthiest list</p>
      	   <p>Well, on their fictional list, anyway</p>
      </div>
      <div><p class="head">I own Area 51</p>
      	   <p>Everyone knows about Area 51 and all the mystery and lore that surrounds that particular spot of land in Nevada, but did you know that, in the Marvel universe at least, I actually own it?</p>
