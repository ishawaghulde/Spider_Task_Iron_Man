             â€•Tony Stark to Bruce Banner </h1>
     <p>Yeah, that's me. Atleast, it <i>was</i>.</p>

     <div class ="row">
      <p>But before that, a bit of history.</p>
    </div>

    <div class ="row">
      <div class = "col-lg-6">
        <p>I was created as the A.I. system that controlled Tony Stark's Mansion and am named after Stark's childhood butler, Edwin Jarvis. And no, I'm just named after him, I am <b>not</b> his butler. I'm like a saviour. I not only helped Stark develop the Iron Man Armor: Mark II, but also found his socks for him when he lost them. I later became the user interface for the Iron Man suit, talking to Stark about plans through the suit and informing him of things such as the suit's systems status, atmospheric and environmental conditions and details about enemies during combat.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "col-lg-6">
       <p>I assisted Doctor Bruce Banner and Tony Stark in using Loki's Scepter to finish the peacemaking program code-named the Ultron Program. In a ditch attempt, the two scientists left me alone to upload the A.I., joining a party that the Avengers were having(I wanted the hulk burgers!!). However, Ultron awakened and quickly realized its situation, questioning where our bodies were. Before I could contact Banner and Stark to alert them to the situation, Ultron violently shut me down, killing me.</p>

   <div class ="row">
    <p><i>Or so they thought.</i></p>

  <div class ="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p>Instead, I secretly went into hiding by spreading my own memory around the Internet to avoid detection, aiding the Avengers against Ultron by preventing the genocidal A.I. from accessing nuclear launch codes by constantly changing them. Stark later realized this when Nick Fury sent him to the "NEXUS" in Oslo and managed to recover me(About time, I's say).</p>
    </div>


    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p> When the Avengers stole Ultron's perfected synthetic body, I was uploaded into it, and by merging with the power of the Infinity Stone, an entirely new being was made: <i>Vision</i></p>
